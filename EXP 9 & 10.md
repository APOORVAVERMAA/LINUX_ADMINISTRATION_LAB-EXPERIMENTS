# Lab 9 & 10: Process and Software Management in Linux

## Objective
This lab focuses on managing processes using essential Linux commands like `ps`, `top`, and `kill`. Additionally, it covers software management using `apt-get`, including installation, updating, and removal of packages.

---

## Process Management
### 1. Viewing Active Processes

#### a. Using the `ps` Command
The `ps` command provides a snapshot of currently running processes.

- **Display processes for the current user:**
  ```bash
  ps
  ```

- **List all system processes:**
  ```bash
  ps -e
  ```

- **Display detailed process information:**
  ```bash
  ps -ef
  ```

#### b. Monitoring with `top`
The `top` command provides a dynamic, real-time overview of system processes and resource usage.

- **Run `top` to monitor system processes:**
  ```bash
  top
  ```

---

#### c. Managing Processes with `kill`
The `kill` command is used to terminate processes.

- **Terminate a process by PID:**
  ```bash
  kill <PID>
  ```

- **Forcefully terminate an unresponsive process:**
  ```bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```

## Software Management
### 2. Installing and Managing Software Packages

#### a. Installing Software
Use `apt-get install` to install software packages.

- **Install `htop`:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install htop
  ```

#### b. Updating System Packages
Keeping system packages up to date is crucial for security and performance.

- **Update the package list:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

- **Upgrade installed packages:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```

---

#### c. Removing Software
Uninstall unnecessary packages to free up system resources.

- **Remove `htop` while keeping configurations:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get remove htop
  ```

- **Completely purge `htop` including configuration files:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get purge htop
  ```

---

### 3. Verifying Software Installation
To confirm whether a package is installed, use the `dpkg` command:
```bash
 dpkg -l | grep htop
```
